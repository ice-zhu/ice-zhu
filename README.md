## Hello and ì•ˆë…•í•˜ì„¸ìš”ðŸ‘‹
My name is Yasmin, an ambitious software engineer with a Bsc. in Computer Science located in Sweden.

### Highlights of Projects and Internships
âœ§ **./ML THESIS** â†’ Developed multiple ML models using Verisure's dataset extracted from PowerBIe. We succesfully developed an ML model that classified application security related threats with 95.94% in F1 Score. [Publication](https://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:mau:diva-77358)

âœ§ **./MERELY EMISSIONS** â†’ Worked as a backend developer at a startup. I was responsible for developing calculation scripts in Python using a REST API and also conducted multiple 1-1 UI/UX evaluation interviews.

âœ§ **./PHYSICS ENGINE** â†’  I developed a physics engine that simulates the motion of particles in a 2D space in Python calculated with Linear Algebra. The engine is capable of handling collisions, forces, and constraints, allowing for realistic simulations of physical systems.
